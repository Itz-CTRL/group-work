GradBridge — System Requirements

1. Project Conceptualization
- Problem Statement:
	Many alumni networks lack a central, lightweight system for graduates to manage their profiles, request official documents (transcripts, testimonials), discover events and jobs, engage in mentorship, and donate — while school administrators need tools to manage requests, track progress, and communicate with alumni. This project delivers an easy-to-deploy alumni portal called "GradBridge".

- Objectives:
	- Provide secure registration and profile management for alumni (including `course` / programme completed).
	- Provide request workflows for transcripts and testimonials with admin review and trackable status.
	- Offer basic community features: events, jobs board, mentorship matching, and newsletter subscriptions.
	- Allow safe admin operations: notifications, trash (soft-delete) management, analytics, and bulk actions.
	- Be deployable on simple PaaS (Render) with Postgres in production and SQLite for local development.

- Key Stakeholders:
	- Alumni (end users): register, update profile, request documents, and engage with services.
	- School administrators: manage requests, approve/reject, add events/jobs, and communicate with alumni.
	- Project maintainers/developers: implement, deploy, and maintain the system.
	- Donors & Partners: provide funding (via donations) and opportunities.

2. Feasibility Analysis

2.1 Technical Feasibility
- Current stack (Flask + Jinja2 + SQLite/Postgres) is straightforward and well-suited for a small-to-medium web app.
- Pros: Fast to prototype, easy to host on Render, minimal dependencies.
- Cons: The single-file app requires refactor to scale (app factory, blueprints); migration tooling (Alembic) would be needed for production schema evolution.

2.2 Economic Feasibility (mock Cost-Benefit Summary)
- Costs (yearly estimates for a small deployment):
	- Managed Postgres (Render/Heroku/Supabase): $30 - $100 / month → $360 - $1,200
	- Render web service (starter plan): $7 - $50 / month → $84 - $600
	- Domain + TLS: $12 - $50/year
	- Maintenance (developer time): 40 hours/year → $1,200 (conservative)
	- Misc tools/monitoring: $100/year
	Total annual cost (low): ~$1,756; (high): ~$3,150

- Benefits (monetized where possible):
	- Improved alumni engagement → potential fundraising increase (e.g., if donations grow by $5,000/year attributable to portal).
	- Admin time savings: automating requests could save ~50 hours/year (~$1,500 value).

- Simple cost-benefit: If the portal helps raise or save $2,500+ per year, it pays for itself. Benefit/cost ratio is expected >1 for typical alumni programs.

2.3 Operational Feasibility
- Operations are lightweight: minimal infra, deploy via Render, routine backups for Postgres, and periodic cron for trash cleanup.
- Admins need a simple operational dashboard and a documented process for sensitive actions (permanent deletes, cron secrets).

4. Process Modeling

4.1 Context Diagram (Level 0 DFD) — description
- External Entities:
	- Alumni (Student user): interacts with web UI to sign up, update profile, request documents, view events/jobs, donate.
	- Admins: use admin UI to review and manage requests, send notifications, run cleanup.
	- Payment Provider (external): optional for donation processing.
	- Email/Notification Service (external): optional for sending newsletters and notifications.

-- System (GradBridge) central box: receives requests from Alumni and Admins, stores data in DB, communicates with external services.

4.2 Level 1 DFD — major sub-processes and data stores (descriptive)
- Sub-processes:
	P1: Authentication & Session Management (sign-up, login, logout)
	P2: Profile Management (view/edit profile, change course)
	P3: Requests Management (create transcript/testimonial requests, update status)
	P4: Notifications & Messaging (create, fetch, mark-read, clear)
	P5: Events & Jobs (CRUD for admins, listing and RSVP/apply for users)
	P6: Trash & Cleanup (soft-delete, restore, permanent delete, scheduled purge)
	P7: Donations & Newsletter (record donations, subscribe newsletters)

- Data Stores:
	- D1: Users table
	- D2: Requests (transcripts/testimonials)
	- D3: Notifications
	- D4: Events, Jobs, Applications
	- D5: Donations, Newsletter subscriptions

- Data flows examples:
	- Alumni → P1 → D1 (create user)
	- Alumni → P3 → D2 (create transcript request)
	- Admin → P3 → D2 (update status, add notes) → P4 → D3 (notify user)

5. Use Case Modeling

5.1 Key Actors
- Student (Alumnus)
- Admin
- External Payment Provider (optional)
- External Email Service (optional)

5.2 Key Use Cases (brief)
- UC1: Sign up
- UC2: Login / Logout
- UC3: Edit Profile (change course)
- UC4: Request Transcript/Testimonial
- UC5: Admin Review Request
- UC6: Soft-delete / Restore / Permanent Delete
- UC7: Send Notification
- UC8: Create Event / RSVP
- UC9: Create Job / Apply

5.3 Detailed Use Case Description — Login

Use Case ID: UC2
Name: Login
Primary Actor: Student or Admin
Goal: Authenticate a user and establish a secure session
Preconditions:
	- User has an account (email & password stored). For Admins, ADMIN_SECRET may be used for bootstrap.
Postconditions:
	- Valid credentials: session established with `user_id`, `email`, `role`, and `course` in session.
	- Invalid credentials: no session; user receives an error message.

Main Success Scenario (Normal Flow):
	1. User navigates to `/login` and submits email & password.
	2. System receives POST and looks up the user by email in `users` store.
	3. System compares submitted password with stored hashed password using `check_password_hash`.
	4. If match, system creates a session: `session['user_id']`, `session['email']`, `session['role']`, `session['name']`, `session['course']` and redirects user to the appropriate dashboard (`/admin/dashboard` for admin, `/student/dashboard` for student).
	5. Success message displayed.

Alternate Flows (Error Handling):
	A1: Missing fields — the system returns an error prompting the user to fill required fields.
	A2: Invalid credentials — the system flashes "Invalid email or password" and logs a failed login attempt.
	A3: Admin SECRET login — if password equals `ADMIN_SECRET`, system checks/creates an admin user row and then signs in.
	A4: DB unavailable — the system shows a temporary error and logs the failure for admins.

6. Logical Design — System Flowchart (text description)

Core Process: "Create Transcript Request" flowchart description

Start -> Display 'New Request' form (student) -> Input validation? [Decision]
	- If NO (validation fails) -> Show validation errors -> End (or loop back to form)
	- If YES -> Save request to `transcripts` with status='processing' -> Notify admins (insert into notifications)
 -> Did DB commit succeed? [Decision]
	- If NO -> Log error, show friendly error to user, offer retry -> End
	- If YES -> Show success message and redirect to Track Requests -> End

Admin Update path (separate flow): Admin edits request -> Save changes -> Append admin notes and update status -> Notify student -> Commit -> If commit fails show error and log.

Error handling includes catching DB exceptions, presenting user-friendly messages, and writing to server logs for operator action.

7. UI/UX Design Principles

Principles applied:
- Clarity: Input fields are labeled clearly, required fields marked, and helper placeholders provided (e.g., course examples).
- Consistency: Shared header/footer partials, consistent button styles (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`), uniform form-group spacing.
- Feedback: Forms show inline errors; success and error flash messages; disabled buttons or spinner when submitting.
- Accessibility: Keyboard-focusable controls, Enter/Space activation for interactive elements, semantic HTML structure.
- Mobile-friendly: Responsive layouts, large touch targets, and footer links for access.

Input Forms (description):
- Signup form: fields for Full Name (required), Email (required), School (required), Course (optional), Password (required), Confirm Password (required). Client-side and server-side validation.
- Profile form: editable fields for Course, Phone, Graduation Year, Social Links, Show in Directory toggles. Save and Cancel actions; save shows confirmation.
- Request form: fields for type (testimonial/official), copies, delivery_method, purpose, addressed_to, notes. Validation ensures type and delivery are present.

Output Screens (description):
- Student Dashboard: displays name, email, course (Program Completed), recent requests with statuses, notifications list.
- Track Requests modal: shows timeline of actions and admin notes for each request.
- Admin Dashboard: statistics cards (total users, events, jobs, donations), lists of new requests with quick actions (view, restore, delete).

8. Implementation Mapping

8.1 ERD → SQL Tables (text mapping)
- Entity: User -> Table: `users` (columns as in section 5). Primary key `id` (INTEGER / SERIAL).
- Entity: TranscriptRequest -> Table: `transcripts` (id, student_email FK to users.email, type, copies, delivery_method, voucher_code, purpose, addressed_to, status, notes, deleted_at, created_at).
- Entity: Notification -> Table: `notifications` (id, user_email, message, created_at, read_flag).
- Entity: Event -> Table: `events`; RSVP -> `event_rsvps`.
- Entity: Job -> Table: `jobs`; Application -> `job_applications`.
- Entity: Mentorship -> Table: `mentorships`.
- Entity: Donation -> Table: `donations`.

8.2 Use Cases → Program Modules (suggested mapping)
- UC2 Login -> Module: `auth` (in current project: `app.py` functions `login`, `admin_login`)
- UC1 Signup -> Module: `auth.signup`
- UC3 Profile Edit -> Module: `profile` (`/profile` handler)
- UC4 Request Transcript/Testimonial -> Module: `requests` (`/api/transcripts` endpoints)
- UC5 Admin Review -> Module: `admin.requests` (`/api/transcripts/<id>/update`)
- UC6 Trash Management -> Module: `admin.trash` (permanent_delete, restore_bulk)
- UC7 Notifications -> Module: `notifications` (`/api/notifications` endpoints)
- UC8 Events/RSVP -> Module: `events` (`/api/events`)
- UC9 Jobs -> Module: `jobs` (`/api/jobs`)

Notes: For maintainability, refactor the single-file Flask app into an application factory with Blueprints: `auth`, `profile`, `requests`, `admin`, `events`, `jobs`, `notifications`.
